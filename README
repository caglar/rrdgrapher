A basic graphing tool for round robin database files.

TO RUN:
  * You can run by python rrd_grapher.py rrd_file_path
  * The png file will be created at the same directory of the RRD file
  * On some systems a libpng error may occure. But you can simply ignore this error.

TODO:
  Add more functionality like exporting in other formats, some statistics from the RRD file
  ...etc.
